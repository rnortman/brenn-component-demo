# `brenn config-check` over this repository's deployer documents.
#
# The fit gates compile, resolve and derive; they never lower, so the refusals
# that live in lowering — a self-description stamp deleted from the shared
# assembly above all — are invisible to them. This runs the binary and the verb
# a bundle installer runs before it stops the service, so a stamp that goes
# missing is a red gate here rather than a boot failure in the browser lane.
#
# Arguments: the `brenn` binary, then every module file, then `--`, then every
# root document. A `--modules` per distinct directory among the module files,
# which is the rule a host is started with and the one an installer's roots
# satisfy.
